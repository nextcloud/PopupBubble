<img src="/docs/screenshot1.png" alt="screenshot" height="1206" width="540">

# Min SDK

Minimum sdk is 19 and support is limited to recyclerview for now.

# Add With Gradle Dependency

```groovy
compile 'com.github.nextcloud:PopupBubble:2.0.0'
```

# Add PopupBubble to layout

```xml
<com.nextcloud.ui.popupbubble.PopupBubble
  android:id="@+id/popup_bubble"
  android:layout_width="wrap_content"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content"
/>
```

Positioning of this view can be done according to the need and is based on `MaterialButton`so all themeing/customization is applicable.

# Access the bubble from Java

```java
PopupBubble popupBubble = (PopupBubble) findViewById(R.id.popup_bubble);
```

Add listener if you want to know when the bubble is clicked

```java
popupBubble.setPopupBubbleListener(new PopupBubble.PopupBubbleClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void bubbleClicked(Context context) {
  
                //popup_bubble is clicked  
            }
        });
```
**Attach with your RecyclerView**
```java
 //necessary to add
popupBubble.setRecyclerView(recyclerView);
```

#Helper Methods

**Hide/Show** PopupBubble according to your need

```java
popupBubble.hide();
popupBubble.show();
```

**Update text dynamically**
Call this method before the activate method to set the new text.

```java
popupBubble.setText("10 new stories");
```

**Update icon dynamically**
Call this method before the activate method to set the new Icon.

```java
popupBubble.setIcon(R.drawable.new_icon);
```

**Update typeface of text dynamically**

# Most Important

Now <b>download/fetch new content</b> in background and then notify your recyclerview adapter about range of items added and finally <b>activate the PopupBubble</b> to make it appear with animation (if not set false).

```java
//Own logic for fetching new content
 .....      
adapter.notifyItemRangeInserted(0,size_of_new_items_added); // size_of_new_items_added = 10 if 10 new items are added.
popupBubble.activate(); 
```
